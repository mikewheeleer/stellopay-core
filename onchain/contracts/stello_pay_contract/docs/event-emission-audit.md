# `stello_pay_contract` event-emission audit

Status: review deliverable for issue #1274. This is a source audit, not a
claim that the current event surface is complete or audited. The table covers
the 77 public entrypoints in `src/lib.rs` on the audited `main` commit. Event
behavior is traced through the wrapper in `src/lib.rs` into `src/payroll.rs`,
and event definitions are listed in `src/events.rs`.

## Method and counting note

The public-entrypoint count is the number of `pub fn` declarations in
`onchain/contracts/stello_pay_contract/src/lib.rs`: 77. The current source
contains 17 direct `.publish(...)` calls in `src/lib.rs` and `src/payroll.rs`,
plus 28 calls to the event helper functions in `src/events.rs`. Counting only
literal `.publish` calls therefore undercounts emissions made through helpers.
The issue's reported 41-call snapshot should be reconciled against the exact
commit used for implementation before any event additions are made.

For this audit:

* **Present** means a successful state-changing path emits an event already
  visible in the implementation.
* **Silent/read** means the entrypoint is a getter or pure conversion and is
  intentionally not an event candidate.
* **Candidate — discuss** means the entrypoint changes configuration,
  upgrade/migration authority, emergency state, or accounting directly but
  has no corresponding event observed in the current path. These are
  prioritized for maintainer discussion; this PR does not add new event
  types or change event payloads.

## Prioritized candidates for maintainer decision

The highest-risk silent mutations are the five emergency entrypoints
(`propose_emergency_pause`, `approve_emergency_pause`, `emergency_pause`, and
`emergency_unpause`, together with guardian configuration), because indexers
cannot reconstruct the emergency authorization timeline from the current
event surface. Next are `upgrade`/`migrate_state` and the admin storage
setters, because they can change executable code or accounting without an
event that identifies the operator and old/new values. Linked-contract and
policy setters follow because indexers may otherwise miss configuration drift.

These priorities are based on the mutation and authorization behavior in
`src/lib.rs` and `src/payroll.rs`, not on an exploitability claim. Before
implementation, maintainers should decide:

1. which of these mutations are part of the supported indexer contract;
2. whether event topics/payloads must preserve existing generated names and
   field shapes;
3. whether emergency proposals and approvals need distinct event identities;
4. what operator, old value, new value, timestamp, and agreement scope are
   allowed in each new payload; and
5. whether direct maintenance setters are intentionally invisible because they
   are migration-only operations, or must be monitored like normal mutations.

## Current test and size baseline

Existing event assertions live in
`onchain/contracts/stello_pay_contract/tests/test_event_emissions.rs`, with
additional path-specific assertions in the milestone, dispute, grace-period,
and upgrade tests. This audit does not change event behavior, so the expected
WASM delta for this PR is **0 bytes**. The issue's stated 10,562-byte headroom
therefore remains unchanged; any future event implementation must report its
measured release-WASM delta and re-run the repository size checks before
merging.

## Findings and limitations

The table records observed emissions, not a formal guarantee that every
delegated branch emits exactly once. Batch operations and the dual legacy/new
agreement paths require targeted tests when maintainers approve candidate
events. The existing event helper names `emit_dsipute_raised` and
`emit_dsipute_resolved` are misspelled in source; changing them would be an
API/internal refactor and is intentionally outside this audit. Existing event
payloads must remain compatible with consumers unless maintainers explicitly
approve a versioning plan.
